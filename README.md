## Detailed help for LEGOÂ® BOOST app programming blocks extracted directly from the Android app

The generated list of programming blocks are similar to the [Boost programming block decoder](https://brickset.com/article/30950/boost-programming-block-decoder) published earlier, but contain more elements and are less organized.

The help is generated directly from the files inside the Android app by client-side JavaScript only (using the included client-side version of [EJS](https://ejs.co/) distributed under the Apache 2.0 license), including the fetching of the images from lego.com by the browser.

The source files must be extracted from the Android app by the user following the steps described in [index.html](https://mdevel1.github.io/LEGO_Boost_programming_blocks_help/).
